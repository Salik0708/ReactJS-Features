Render Props:
The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

Example:
Considering React-router library, <Route /> holds the behavior of navigating to different pages. It renders the component when the path matches.

<Route path='/page' component={Page} />

const extraProps = { color: 'red' }

<Route path='/page' render={(props) => (
  <Page {...props} data={extraProps}/>
)}/>


Note: you can use any prop name other than “render” to takes in a function.
