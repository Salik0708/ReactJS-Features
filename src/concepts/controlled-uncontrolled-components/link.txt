Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

Note:
      we recommend using controlled components to implement forms.

Controlled Component:
      In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. 
      
Uncontrolled Component:
      In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself.

Wrap Up and Key Takeaways:

1. Use controlled components whenever possible.

2. Controlled components do not require a form element in order to be considered a controlled component.

3. If a component has an input element that has a value attribute bound to state and an event handler to update said state, it is a controlled component.

4. For pages that have a large number of input elements, it can be cumbersome to work with controlled components.

5. Data flow is uni-directional in controlled components with the state within the component acting as the single source of truth.

6. All state changes within a controlled component should be made via the setState function.

7. Uncontrolled components store their data in the DOM like a traditional HTML input element.
